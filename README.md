A machine learning model to predict diabetes using health parameters.
# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses supervised machine learning models to predict whether a person is diabetic based on medical attributes. It was developed as part of **Week 1 Task** during my internship at **[InternPe](https://www.linkedin.com/company/internpe/)**.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset
- **Features used**:
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - Blood Pressure
  - Skin Thickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - Diabetes Pedigree Function
  - Age

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest Classifier

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
